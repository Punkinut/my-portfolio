# My Portfolio

## Deployment

My Portfolio has been deployed here:
[Portfolio](https://punkinut.github.io/my-portfolio/)

## Why make this?
Whenever I'm looking to display my work or talents I will have this webpage to reference in the future. It is an online libaray of me and my skills!

## My goal
I decided to follow my design instincts and went for something modern and sleek. I wanted to have a combination of flex and interesting grid layouts. For time sake I did not add a mobile navigation as it does not say in the criteria. I also wanted to experiment with absoloute positioning in order to add elements around the page. Since the portfolio, I have divided each section up into different cards!
