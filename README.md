# My Portfolio
## Why make this?
Whenever I'm looking to display my work or talents I will have this webpage to reference in the future. It is an online libaray of me and my skills!

## My goal
I decided to follow my design instincts and went for something modern and sleek. I wanted to have a combination of flex and interesting grid layouts. For time sake I did not add a mobile navigation as it does not say in the criteria. I also wanted to experiment with absoloute positioning in order to add elements around the page. Since the portfolio, I have divided each section up into different cards!

## Card One (Landing Page)
This card contains the navigation and the landing content. The main content is placed in a 2 column grid. On the left is the text content and on the right is the large folder icon. It is positioned absolute, relative to it's parent in order for it to stick to the edge of the text-box and the screen-size changes. The white swerve in the bottom right corner is also an image positioned using the same method as the folder.

## Card Two (Facts about me)
This card contains three interesting points about myself, displayed inside of a grid. It is a standard three column grid with flex boxes inside. When the screen width gets too small, the grid changes into a multi row, one column grid.

## Card Three (Mini bio)
This card contains a self portrait and a little information about myself. For styling I tried to make the text box look like a square speech bubble! I used my skills and used Adobe Illustrator to make the triangle icon and positioned it in such a way for it to work. The content is also in a two column grid.

## Card Four (Skills)
This part is kind of funny because it lists some skills I have yet to learn. I had to go into Adobe Illustrator and image trace all the logos myself in order for this section to work. I have multiples grids inside of a grid - yes this part got a little complicated!

## Card Five (Works)
This is probably one of my favourite cards because it contains an interesting take on grids- it's uneven! On the second and fourth grid box element I added relative positioning. I also made the Javascript box much larger than the other for it to look unique. The faint box shadow also gives the content some flare.

## Card Six (Contact)
This is the final section of the page which contains for fake information... It is again a simple grid layout with some interesting positioned elements.

## End note
I hope you enjoyed going through my webpage. This is about the best I can do in a week or less :)
